Introduction
The aim of this analysis is to evaluate  employee performance for HR analytics to provide valuable insights to the organizations in terms of employee engagement, productivity and overall organizational effectiveness.
For this analysis, I used  Microsoft Excel along with PivotTables to summarize the data, which was then visualized through charts. The analysis focused on the performance by department, age,educational background of the employees and the recruitment channel.

 Male employees have a higher KPI value (1,809) compared to female employees (822).
The Operations department has the highest KPI, confirming its strong productivity.
Employees recruited through referrals have the lowest total KPI (169), while "Others" as a recruitment channel has the highest KPI (1,018).
The Technology department leads in performance within specific roles, with a KPI value of 41. Male employees in this department have a KPI of 116, while female employees have 53.
Region 2 consistently tops performance charts with the highest KPI values (460).
Employees with a bachelorâ€™s degree have the highest KPI (4,123), while those with a master's degree or above have a KPI of 1,783.
Employees with one training session had the highest KPI (3,380), while those with two training sessions had a lower KPI (600).
Experience does not significantly impact performance in this dataset.
The best-performing department is Operations (1,076 KPI), followed by Sales & Marketing and Technology.

Recommendations

Investigate factors contributing to the performance disparity between male and female employees. Implement targeted mentorship programs and skill development initiatives.
Analyze the strategies used in the Operations department and apply them across other departments to improve overall productivity.
Reassess the referral hiring process and refine it to attract high-performing candidates. Expand recruitment strategies that have yielded better KPI outcomes.
Provide targeted training and support to female employees in technology roles to improve their KPI performance.
 Identify key success factors in Region 2 and apply them to lower-performing regions to enhance overall efficiency.
Evaluate whether employees with master's degrees or above are in roles that fully utilize their skills. Implement career progression plans to ensure their expertise is leveraged effectively.
Ensure training sessions are outcome-driven and relevant to employees' roles. Focus on improving the quality rather than increasing the number of training sessions.
Conduct further analysis to determine if experience contributes indirectly to leadership or problem-solving skills. Adjust job roles and responsibilities accordingly.
Use insights from high-performing departments to develop strategies for weaker departments. Promote collaboration and knowledge sharing between teams.
